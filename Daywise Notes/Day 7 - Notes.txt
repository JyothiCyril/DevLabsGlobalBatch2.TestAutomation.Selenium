2. Push the project into Remote GitHub Location

3. add the QAE as collaborators

4. The collaborators will receive the email notification to access the project in GitHUb

**

5 . Open the PR received by QA and review

6. Merge the content of branch x to the master branch.


QA :

1. Email notification to accept the invitation
2. clone the project from TL github to the local system / ws
3. Add the code / modify the code
4. Commit the new code / modified code into a new Branch --> Create branch and commit the changes into the branch
5. Send the PR (Pull Request to the Author (TL) for review the changes)

…or create a new repository on the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/JyothiCyril/EMS.TestAutomation.git
git push -u origin main
…or push an existing repository from the command line
