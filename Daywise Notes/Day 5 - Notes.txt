Reporting mechanism while working with Selenium & TestNG using ExtentReports API.


Selenium do not have an in-built mechanism to generate the test results

While TestNG report gets appended on every test execution.


Create a generic that can create separate report for every test execution.

Reports folder within the project directory.


Generic class should run whenever the test execution is triggered by an testng.xml file.


Listeners in TestNG which help to read the test execution of a method annotated as @Test.

Either the test can be passed / failed / Skipped.

Fetch the status of the results and add them to HTML report generated.

Working with JavaScriptExecutor - Interface used for Java scripts actions on the pages

ScrollBy actions..
Vertical bar
Horizontal bar

scroll by element presence.

--------------------------------------------


Synchronization Point: It is a process of matching the anticipated time between the tool and the application.

* Tool is very fast and the application is slow. we need to pause the execution for a while till the desired response is received from an application under test.

1. PageLoadTimeOut --> driver for a page to load completely. Browser only
2. ImplicitWait --> Driver is initialize and terminated, the implicit wait methos will wait till the element on the browser is visible.
3. ExplicitWait : Wait inserted in the code and wait untill the action / expected outcome is fetched.

Auto cut off once the desired action is completed.
